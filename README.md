# Different Coloured Tea

Different Coloured Tea is a website to spread awareness to tea drinkers that only had black tea or black and green tea.
The visitor will find out that there is other tea than black and green tea also red (rooibos), white, yellow, blue and purple tea, I will also mention Oolong tea that is often a bit grayish brown with a hint of yellow often called in between black and green, the site does not plan to mention for example the huge quantity of tea from each colour or herbal tea, it will also include pictures of the different colours..

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- I wanted to make an event information, also to get links from every picture on Home to the correct line in About Tea, make buttons change colour when marked, creating a couple of icons and maybe something more that I haven't thought about.

## Testing 

I have tested all links and buttons including navbar and they all work, the form also work and requires an email in email field, one of the radio buttons and the name fields filled in, but checkbox is optional.
I have tested on Chrome, Firefox and Edge without a problem, checked on many different sized from about 280p to 2000 px wide and 400px to about 2000 px high and didn't find any problems with the responsiveness.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://alexanderaberg.github.io/Different-Coloured-Tea/index.html) Also checked About Tea and Contact Us pages without any errors.
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Falexanderaberg.github.io%2FDifferent-Coloured-Tea%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=sv) it got validated as CSS Stage 3 +SVG!

### Unfixed and fixed Bugs

Solved all bugs.
Had some issues with fixing the header and did it with the help of a tutor same thing with photos on larger screens which you can see in the css.
I did much trial and error with forms, pictures, header and footer and went through many colours on About Tea until my mentor suggested that I use the tea colour as background which made it possible to have text and background fit together better, I also did choose black as background for menu bar and contact form, the contact form I still wanted to see the background through which I sorted with the help of opacity.
I also got some help from my slack team for the header.

I would say that the header is by far what I had biggest problems with.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
